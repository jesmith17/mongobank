# Getting Started

## Purpose
MongoBank is a hands-on tutorial for developers that are wanting to get more comfortable with developing against the MongoDB database. Based on spring-boot and spring-data
the work shops leads users through the process of creating a simulated banking app with customers, accounts, and transactions.

## Getting Started

Assumptions:
* Java is installed on your system
* Docker is installed on your machine
* Maven or Gradle is installed on your machine


### Setup Database

The system, when completed, is dependent on some features only available in MongoDB Atlas (Cloud Database as a Service). Fortunately we can use the Atlas Docker image to
test our code for functionality in a local environment.

        You can also use a Free tier instances from MongoDB Atlas.

:::tip

To complete the advanced topics you will need to use MongoDB Atlas. You can run Atlas via docker with the instructions found here
[Atlas in Docker](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/current/atlas-cli-deploy-docker/)

### Download Code Repository

Clone this github repo to a location on your machine.

```shell
    git clone xxxxxx
```

### Update connection strings

Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project. Inside that file add the following entries

```
MONGODB_URI= <your connection string here>

```

Your connection string is going to be similar to
` mongodb://localhost:27017 `. The specific port that shows will depend on the port mapptings you provided the Atlas docker container when you started it. 

### Build the application

Lets build the application to see that it run successfully. MongoBank is configured to work with both Gradle and Maven, so choose
which every is comfortable or configured on your system. 

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="maven" label="Maven" default>
```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">
    ``` shell
    ./gradlew bootRun
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Depending on the build tool you prefer to use.

### Test that API calls work

The base system provides REST API endpoints, so lets verify that those are working and returning content.

```shell
curl locahost:8080/api/hello -H "Content-Type:application/json"
```

The response should look like

```
Hello World
```

If you get to this point you have everything ready to start the lab. Click on the link below for "Saving Objects" to start.
