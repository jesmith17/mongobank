Cover additional advanced topics for individuals who want to address more complex scenarios. 


## Full Text Search

Add in support for full text search using Atlas Search to gain ability to search text blocks for content. 

Using the `Customer` model, add in support for fuzzy matching on customer name.

Create the following method in your `CustomerRepository` class

```java

List<Customer> searchCustomersByName(String searchText);

```

Leveraging the `@Aggregation` method we will implement an Atlas Search query against the data. Directly above the new method add this

```java

@Aggregation(pipeline= {"{'$search': {index:'customer_search', text:{ query:?0, fuzzy:{},path:['lastName','firstName','address.city','address.state','address.zip','phones.number','emails.email']}}}"})

```

### Create Search Index


<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="shell" label="Shell">

    At the terminal run the following command

    ```shell

    mongosh "mongodb://localhost:27017/?directConnection=true"
    ```

    Once inside the mongosh run the following to create the index

    ```shell
    use bank;

    db.customers.createSearchIndex("customer_search", {mappings: {dynamic: true}})
    ```

    This creates an Atlas Search index using the dynamic mappings, which indexes all of the fields in the document.

    :::tip
    You can also access a MongoDB shell environment from Compass. Select the button in the top right corner that says "Open MongoDB Shell"
    :::
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="atlas" label="Atlas">
        You can also create search indexes via the Atlas Web Console.

        Navigate to the specific cluster you want to create the index in and look for the tab labeled `Atlas Search`. Follow the instructions to create a dynamic index with the name `customer_search` against all
        fields in the document

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Update additional controller and service code as needed to use the new search component. 

:::tip
 Have the controller accept a single string input that would be similar to a Google Search type interface.
 You can then ask Atlas Search to compare that input string against an array of fields in your document, giving you a high level of search flexibility.
